Use Effect in Hook
======================
======================


* Hooks are new addition in React 16.8. Without writing a class.
* The effect hook lets you perform side effects in function components.
* Side effects means - basically anything that affects somethings outside of the scope of the current function that's being executed.

Example - 1. API request to our backend service.
          2. Calls to our authentication service.
          3. Error tracking calls to Sentry.


***Important:- 1. useEffect call itself automatically.
               2. In a component, if every things will be done then execute useEffect at the end.

* useEffect takes two arrguments first is call back function and second is dependency array.

* Inside any condition we can't use React hooks.
